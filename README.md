 - I attempted to earn an “Exceeds Expectations” grade. “Extra Credit” features I added:

"Search", "Modal toggle", "Structure, style and CSS".

- CSS changes I made:

Background color changes in the body, the employee's "card", the "modal" and the button to close. Color changes in employee information and a color and background change effect when passing over a "card".
I added an enlarged animation for the "model" when it appears and when changing employees.
